npx yo @saritasa/react:component Deep/Nested/MyComponent

# creates PROJECT_ROOT/my_source_root/MyComponent
npx yo @saritasa/react:component MyComponent --source-root=my_source_root

# generates plain js without flow-types
npx yo @saritasa/react:component MyComponent --no-flow

# generates component without unit tests
npx yo @saritasa/react:component MyComponent --no-unit

# generates component without stories
npx yo @saritasa/react:component MyComponent --no-stories
